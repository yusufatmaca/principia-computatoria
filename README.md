> *"To understand the machine is to understand the mind of the maker."*

This repository serves as a personal knowledge base and a persistent digital bookshelf. It was created to archive valuable resources—articles, university courses, white papers, and manuals—that I have encountered during my career as a Computer Scientist.

The landscape of software engineering, particularly in low-level systems and high-performance computing, is vast. I created this collection primarily to safeguard these references against loss and to organize my own learning path. However, I have made it public in the hope that fellow engineers, researchers, and students traversing the same depths of computer science will find these maps useful.

## 🏛️ Philosophy
Principia Computatoria is a personal and public treatise on computing. It embraces:
- First principles thinking
- Breadth with depth across CS subfields
- Elegant, minimalist curation
- High signal, zero noise
- Longevity over trends

This is not a bookmark dump. It is a structured, evolving handbook.

## 🤝 Contribution
This repository is primarily a personal archive, so I am selective about what gets added. The goal is *curation*, not *collection*.
